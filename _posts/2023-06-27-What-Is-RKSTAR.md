RKSTAR - "RECONS K STAR" aims to provide the scientific community with a volume-limited, volume-complete sample of the nearest K dwarf stars within 50 pc 
of the Sun. The catalog searches for K dwarfs through primary astrometric surveys, Gaia DR3, DR2, and Hipparcos, and includes information on astrometry,
multiplicity indicators, photometry, and IDs through various relevant catalogs. The RKSTAR catalog is aiming for its' first version public release by 
Q4 2024/Q1 2025, aimed at wide companions through Gaia/WDS.
