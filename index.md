My name is Tim Johns. I am a 3rd year graduate student at Georgia State University. I am a fellow for the 1.5m SMARTS Telescope in Cerro Tololo, Chile.
I am interested in low-mass stars, specifically, multiplicity and exoplanet detections around the understudied K dwarf stars. See more about my research,
the [RKSTAR (RECONS K STAR) Catalog]{https://astrotimj.github.io/RKSTAR.md}, involving cataloguing every nearby K dwarf star within 50 pc of the Sun and their companions in the "RKSTAR" tab.
