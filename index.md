My name is Tim Johns. I am a 3rd year graduate student at Georgia State University, a member of the [RECONS Consortium](http://recons.org), and a fellow for the 1.5m SMARTS Telescope in Cerro Tololo, Chile. I am interested in low-mass stars, specifically, multiplicity and exoplanet detections around the understudied K dwarf stars. See more about my research, the [RKSTAR (RECONS K STAR) Catalog](https://astrotimj.github.io/blog), involving cataloguing every nearby K dwarf star within 50 pc of the Sun and their companions in the "RKSTAR" tab.

For fun, I enjoy competitive Pokemon battling, going to rock/metal concerts, and playing guitar.
